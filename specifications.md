JS Final Project - by Bogdan Livadaru

First Page:
- Home Page with button to ask for a random advice using an api (advice slip api - https://api.adviceslip.com/)
- Favorite button. Adds the current advice to your favourites, an account is needed and can be made. I will be using a local JSON file to handle username and passwords.
- A navbar will also be visible here and on all other pages.

Second Page:
- Profile page where you can see all the advices you favourited.
- Another part of the page will conclude of a input box where the user can add his own advice to the list of favourites.

Third Page:
- Search for a user to see his public favourite advices. Also to note, users can set any favourites to private so only he can see them.

**I have more functionality and small stuff i have in mind that might be added to the final website but this is the jist of it.**
